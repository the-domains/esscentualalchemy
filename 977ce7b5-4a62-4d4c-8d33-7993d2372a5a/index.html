 Amanda has been into natural scents her whole life, having grown up on 
an Iowa farm.  After majoring in music during college, she discovered 
that her love and knowledge of music translated into another language, 
the language of scent.  Composition of music and perfume are created 
using many of the same terms and concepts.  Amanda often uses great 
works of art, music, and literature as inspiration for her perfume 
creations.  The rest, as they say, is scented history.</p><p> About My Natural Perfumes</p><p>
 I am a classically trained opera singer. Specifically I am a lyric 
coloratura. In late 2010, I came across the image of Septimus Piesseâ€™s 
Odophone: individual essences as musical notes, that was the clincher. 
It seemed the Universe was pulling two loves together. Thinking of 
making music for the nose, tantalized me. So when I started learning 
perfumery, it made sense to me that I should start off with classical 
perfume ingredients. My musical training has been a vital part of my 
ability to formulate perfumes.</p><p> How did I come up with the name for my business, you might wonder?</p><p> These three words:</p><p> Essential: refers to that which is in the natural composition of a thing.</p><p> Sensual: the enjoyments derived from the senses, especially from the gratification or indulgence of physical appetites</p><p>
 Alchemy: any magical power or process of transmuting a common 
substance, usually of little value, into a substance of great value.</p><p>
 I draw inspiration from many place - literature, music, visual art. 
Sometimes words inspire me to create. Recently, I dreamed about a new 
perfume, which I am now turning from something ethereal into the 
tangible. What I do my best to convey to people when they wear my 
perfumes is emotion in a bottle. I like to tell people a beautiful 
natural perfume should take you someplace emotionally, and make you 
think. Similar to art you can't stop looking at to try and discover the 
meaning behind the piece. Music that is so beautiful it makes you cry, 
or the book you can't put down until you've finished it, because the 
author crafted such a compelling story. When I create a perfume, those 
things are always part of my vision for the final product.</p><p> 
Esscentual Alchemy is unique because I use my training as an opera 
singer, when I compose my natural perfumes. There are many similarities 
between composing music, and perfume. Each have notes, and chords. You 
want your composition to be balanced nicely, and "don't end on the 
seven!" A music joke meaning you want a harmonious resolution. I feel 
that my music training has enriched my perfume artistry, and adds 
another layer of complexity to my scented compositions. Natural perfumes
 help people connect with the natural world around them. I find people 
pleasantly surprised at the positive emotional experience they have when
 wearing a natural perfume. Natural perfumes are an aroma-therapeutic 
experience, since our sense of smell is one of the most powerful senses 
we have.</p><p> "Fragrance takes you on a journey of time. You can 
walk down the street and pass someone and get taken back 20 years. It's 
very Proustian that way." ~ Daphne Guinness </p><p> I hope you enjoy my creations.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="19"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="20"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="21"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="22"><span data-reactid="23"><!-- react-empty: 24 --><h2 data-reactid="25"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="26"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="29"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
