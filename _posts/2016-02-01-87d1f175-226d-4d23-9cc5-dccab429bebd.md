For the Love of Bees natural perfume

Honeyed crème brulée, topped with tangy-sweet berries. You wear it when you're in the mood to be playful, carefree and flirty. 
  
For the Love of Bees reminds us that nature is responsible for some of 
the most beautiful fragrances. The honeyed, slightly green sweetness of 
natural beeswax can be intoxicating on its own, but with the addition of
vanilla and ylang ylang, it becomes an even more delicious caramel 
delight. The tartness of black currant and sweet carrot seed add flirty 
dimension, while honeysuckle and chamomile provide a subtle whisper of 
botanical florals. 
  
For the Love of Bees is happiness bottled. You can't help but smile every time you smell it.
