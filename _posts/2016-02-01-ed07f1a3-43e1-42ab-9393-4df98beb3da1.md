Hokkabaz Natural Perfume

An ode to the mysteries of the ancient world. You wear it because you 
find beauty things that are challenging, unique, and enigmatic.   
Hokkabaz is an ode to a scent created during the time period after the 
discovery of the remains of the Egyptian king Tutankhamun. It was the 
early part of the 20th century, and the world developed an unquenchable 
fascination with ancient Egyptian culture and its artifacts. 
  
Hokkabaz is a creation that is not for everyone. Its stormy opening of 
vetiver, oakmoss and embalming spices are reminiscent of a violent dust 
storm that settles into a glorious aftermath. Rose, patchouli, orris, 
sandalwood, and the subtle sweetness of vanilla remain to provide a 
bewitching trail, with just a hint of clove to sustain the mystery.
