Little Black Dress

The little black dress is always appropriate. You wear Little Black 
Dress because you want your attitude to compliment your wardrobe.
  
Lovers of the movie "Breakfast at Tiffany's" worship Audrey Hepburn's 
iconic Holly Golightly. She is the epitome of elegance and confidence, 
and wore the black dress like no other woman. Since then, women have 
been on a perpetual hunt for perfect black dresses, and usually have 
several options to choose from.
  
Little Black Dress goes with all your little black dresses. It is the 
scent of confident femininity, but leaves plenty of room for fun. Juicy,
sparkling bergamot pairs perfectly with seductive jasmine, while rose 
peeks out of the background. Ginger lily offers up a spicy creaminess 
without becoming overwhelmingly heady, and the sexy, woody base of civet
and sandalwood wraps up the bouquet with classic style. Holly Golightly
would have loved it, and so will you. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/54e1459d-5791-4f4a-bfd0-6304863efdc1.jpg)
