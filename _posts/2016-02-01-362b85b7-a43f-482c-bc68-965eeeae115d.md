Autumn Spice natural perfume

Spicy, comforting warmth with a hint of citrus. You love it because 
autumn is your favorite season, and the aromas of wood, warming spices, 
and cool, crisp air are a balm to your soul. 
  
Autumn is the season of the bountiful harvest, when we revel in the 
moderating temperatures that bring us clear, starry evenings, and 
sun-dappled days that showcase nature's most glorious tones. 
  
Autumn Spice lets us carry the season on our skin, with the crisp 
tartness of juicy blood orange, combined with the sunny freshness of 
bergamot, melded with aromatic, creamy myrrh, calming lavender, and 
sweet patchouli. As day turns to evening, the cinnamon and nutmeg take 
center stage with their comforting warmth, while sandalwood and civet 
combine to provide a musky, woody element that offers a hint of 
sexiness. 
  
Autumn Spice is the perfect scent to wear when you're cuddled up in 
front of the fire with someone you love, or wish you could be.
