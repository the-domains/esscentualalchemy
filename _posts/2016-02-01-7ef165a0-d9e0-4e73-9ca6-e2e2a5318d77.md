Blushing Beauty Natural Perfume

Warmth; powder; sweetness. You love it because you're drawn to classic, elegant, understated scents.
  
Fragrance connoisseurs who enjoy scents anchored by warm, wistful notes,
with subtle floral notes lurking in the background, will enjoy Blushing
Beauty.
  
The fragrance begins its journey on the skin with bright, crisp 
bergamot, and settles quickly to allow the warmth of ambergris, tonka 
and benzoin to emerge.
  
The combination of the three notes forms a powdery cloud, with the 
florals ringing the circumference like the sun trying to break through a
summer thunderstorm. The earthiness of iris root dominates the drydown,
enhancing the warmth and sophistication, while maintaining the 
integrity of the floral notes. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/04a87006-5742-4ca0-b332-422cba17fec6.jpg)
