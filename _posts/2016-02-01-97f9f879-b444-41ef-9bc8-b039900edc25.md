Dreams of Smoke Natural Perfume

Dreams take you anywhere you want to go. The images of those dreams are 
fleeting, but they linger in the mind. We remember what we see, what we 
hear, what we taste, and what we smell. The senses ensure that the 
memories linger forever, but when the scent reappears, the experiences 
come rushing back as if we are still living them.
  
The lingering smell of smoke can be comforting. Whether it comes from a 
fireplace, a camp fire, or the smoky flavors of some of our favorite 
foods, smoke elicits a powerful reaction. The unique smokiness of 
Lapsang Souchong tea evokes comfort, along with soothing memories of the
place where I drank it: the sitting room of the Merrion Hotel in 
Dublin, Ireland, on a cold, rainy November day. Warm tendrils of smoke 
rose from my porcelain cup, complimented by a splash of cream and a bit 
of sugar. Every time I drink a cup of Lapsang Souchong, I am transported
across the Atlantic, to a room with a roaring fire, a floral chintz 
sofa, and exquisite dark wood paneling that made me feel warm and safe.
  
Dreams of Smoke recaptures those memories. Lapsang Souchong is entwined 
with orange blossom, Rose de Mai, spices, Madagascan vanilla, 
sandalwood, beeswax and honey. Inhaling the tendrils of smoke brings me 
back to those chilly days, warming my heart and recreating my dreams. 
Florals enhance the experience, and the creamy undertones of vanilla and
honey bring a smile to my face. Long after I take the last sip from my 
cup, the lingering scent makes me smile, because the memories are always
with me. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/573b3a49-1b84-4419-94a7-9e7c1541c00c.JPG)
