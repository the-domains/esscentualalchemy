Bottom's Dream Natural Perfume

Bottoms' Dream natural botanical perfume is whimsical, fruity, fun, and 
flirty. You love it because you gravitate toward scents that are unique 
and maybe just a tad elusive. 
  
Fans of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" know Bottom as the 
teller of lover's tales. His namesake scent evokes the romance of roses 
and jasmine, made playful and jammy by the addition of juicy peach. 
Herbaceous tagetes, and a twist of green from araucaria, give the scent a
slight black licorice aroma at first, subsiding to allow the sweetness 
of the peach to shine through, while the roses and jasmine come out to 
play in the scent's third act. This is not a loud, "in your face" floral
composition, but one that is playful, flirty and romantic. 
  
Bottom is the scent to wear when you're feeling spritely, mischievous, and in the mood for love.
