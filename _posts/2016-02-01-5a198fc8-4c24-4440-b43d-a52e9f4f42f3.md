Audax Fortes Natural Cologne

The scent of a wood-paneled library, populated with antique volumes, 
leather club chairs, perfectly aged cigars, and brandy. Men and women 
alike are equally comfortable in these surroundings, as well as in this 
scent.
  
Audax Fortes can be interpreted as irrepressibly masculine, but in the 
world of perfumery, it is genderless. Leather has long been used to add 
sexiness to fragrance compositions, for both men and women. Here, we 
have leather combined with castoreum, civet and tobacco -- the masculine --
alongside pink pepper, which adds a spicy, feminine freshness.
  
Audax Fortes is a scent to wear when you're reading a book in front of 
the fire, accompanied by the softest blanket, and a cup of robust black 
tea. It brings warmth and comfort to the coldest winter days, as well as
an appealing presence to intimate gatherings.
